    <p>This week I learned that I we are doing a lot more stuff in this class than i thought.<br>I thought we might just be doing computer stuff 
    or maybe just hands on stuff but apparently we are doing a bunch of stuff.<br>
    On monday we did this little competition in class where each half of class had to use a bunch of pipes to roll a ball into a bucket.
    Then we started tinkercad which is really annoying to do with a touchpad.</p>

    <p>This week I think that we took a safety test. The safety test was really short and I think I did okay on it.<br>
   Then we started a project to make a Rube Goldberg machine, which starts with a tinkercad design that really hurts your finger if you dont have a mouse. </p>

    <P>This week we started working on the actual Rube Goldberg machine. Me and my group chose a fairly simple design so it wouldnt take too long to build<br>
    Brandon is a maniac and put rediculous amounts of tape on everything which made us end up taking a really long time to make the machine anyways.</P>
