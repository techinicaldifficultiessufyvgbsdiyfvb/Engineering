    <p><b>Journal 1; Week 2</b></p>
    <p>This week I learned that I we are doing a lot more stuff in this class than i thought.<br>I thought we might just be doing computer stuff 
    or maybe just hands on stuff but apparently we are doing a bunch of stuff.<br>
    On monday we did this little competition in class where each half of class had to use a bunch of pipes to roll a ball into a bucket.
    Then we started tinkercad which is really annoying to do with a touchpad.</p>
    <p><b>Journal 2; Week 3</b></p>
    <p>This week I think that we took a safety test. The safety test was really short and I think I did okay on it.<br>
   Then we started a project to make a Rube Goldberg machine, which starts with a tinkercad design that really hurts your finger if you dont have a mouse. </p>
    <P><b>Journal 3; Week 4</b></P>
    <P>This week we started working on the actual Rube Goldberg machine. Me and my group chose a fairly simple design so it wouldnt take too long to build<br>
    Brandon is a maniac and put rediculous amounts of tape on everything which made us end up taking a really long time to make the machine anyways.</P>
    <p><b>Journal 4; Week 5</b></p>
    <p>This week we basically just worked on our Rube Goldberg machine. Thats really all I have to say. Brandon beinng Brandon was of course overtaping everything and I'm not really sure this project will work.</p>
    <p><b>Journal 4; Week 6</b></p>
    <p>This week we finished the Rube Goldberg machine and it worked!!! I don't have any pictures or videos of now though.</p>
    <p><b>Journal 5; Week 7</b></p>
    <p>This week we dissected a laptop. It sucked. It really did. I don't think we really did it right. Brandon got so upset half way through and didn't really help on the second day. I'm pretty sure we lost some of the screws but at least we didn't just stuff everything in withought securing it like some groups.</p>
    <p><b>Journal 6; Week 8</b></p>
    <p>This week we did a couple things. I believe we designed a little turtle prosthetic in tinkercad. I really can't remember what we did other than that. I think we had a lecture. There really wasn't much this week at least that I can remember.</p> <center><img src = "turtlefin.png"></center>
    <p><b>Journal 7; Week 9</b></p>
    <p>This week we built a bottle rocket. Although it was supposed to go horizontally and so was more of an airplane than a rocket. <br>
    We decided that we would make kind of a double dorito sandwitching the bottle in the middle. After designing we went and tested it. It did not go well. Very sad... :(</p>

        <p><b>Journal 8; Week 10</b></p>
        <p>This week we did environmental engineering. It was ok I don't really care that much, the project was kind of bland too and not very interesting. So yeah not very fun overall.</p>
        <p><b>Journal 9; Week 11</b></p>
        <P>This week I was really sick so I missed everything and don't really know what we did but I think we did something on TinkerCAD about electronic engineering.</P>
        <p><b>Journal 10; Week 12</b></p>
        <p>This week we continued Electrical Engineering which was ok. I missed the first part so I dodn't really know what I was doing but, Idid make this cool little flashing light circuit.</p>
        <p><b>Journal 11; Week 13</b></p>
        <p>After a bit more electrical engineering, we started civil engineering, and also our final project, the Spaghetti Bridge. The bridge is stupid hard. NOne of the people in my group including me have the patience to build anything structurally sound, and the best bridge someone made was just a rope of soggy spaghetti and a ton of glue.</p>
        <p><b>Journal 12; Semester 2; Week 1</b></p>
        <p>This week was comepletely uneventful it was just getting back into school</p>
        <p><b>Journal 13; Week 2</b></p>
        <p>This week I was sick most of the time so I missed out on the lessons.</p>
        <p><b><center>>Mousetrap Car Project(6 weeks)</center></b></p>
        <p>This project was very long and a little bit tedious. We started with a rather basic tinkerCAD. After that using the same dimensions, we made the actual body. After that, we got dowels straws and the CD's which would be the wheels. We had a bit of problems getting to use the hot glue guns which slowed us down significantly, but there wasn't much we could do about that. After that was all made, we got our mousetrap and string. One of the mistaks we made was not getting better string. Our string was absolutely terrible and made the spin very bad. Additionally one of the axels were bent and irreplaceable which kind of screwed us. With a combination of all these problems, our car didn't do very well.</p>
        <p><b><center>Journal 15; Week 9</center></b></p>
        <p>This week we did a little boat project. The boat project we where we make a gutter boat and then blow it down a gutter. Me and my group had absolutely no idea what we were doing. We kinda gave up half way through and just randomly taped stuff on, but it actually did pretty well. I think we could have improved the design a lot but I had a lot of fun with it. Unfortunately, we don't have any pictures.</p>
        <p><b><center>Journal 16; Week 11</center></b></p>
        <P>This week we started an egg project. The goal is to have it drop three stories withought breaking. We have to design a carrier to make it safely down.</P>
